Description: Sirikata is a BSD-licensed open source platform for virtual worlds.
   Sirikata is a BSD-licensed open source platform for virtual worlds. We
   aim to provide a set of open libraries and protocols which anyone can
   use to deploy a virtual world.  Sirikata isn’t a single virtual world,
   it’s a platform for building virtual worlds. All the common, core
   components of virtual worlds are built-in — servers that simulate the
   world and distribute content, a graphical client, and scripting
   language support — allowing you to focus on creating the objects and
   behaviors unique to your world. These videos give a sense of what you
   can currently do in Sirikata worlds.
