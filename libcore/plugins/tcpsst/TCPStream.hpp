/**
 * This is a particular example implementation of the Stream interface sitting atop TCP.
 * The protocol specified in the Structured streams paper http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/uia/sst/
 * May be used as another implementation of the Stream interface. This is provided as the
 * default implementation as it supports a wide range of network devices and is not subject to
 * prejudice against UDP connections which we routinely see on the net (my home system gets 10
 * second lag on UDP connections just due to ISP policy combating P2P networks)
 *
 * The protocol is as follows:
 *
 * --Connection--
 * To connect to a remote host, the client opens a small number (N) of TCP sockets to that host
 * and sends the version string (currently SSTTCP ), an ascii 2 digit representation of N (in this case '03')
 * and a 16 byte unique ID used to pair up connections and possibly in the future for encryption
 * The other side respinds in turn on each connection with a similar handshake (though the 16 bytes may be different)
 * now the connection is online. The remote host may immediately follow the handshake with live packets and
 * the other side may respond as soon as it receives the remote hosts handshake response
 *
 * --Live Phase--
 * The first live stream has StreamID of 1. New streams coming from listener must have even StreamID's and new
 * streams coming from connector must have odd stream ID's.
 * To indicate a new substream, simply send a packet with a new stream ID
 *
 * --Packet Format--
 * All packets are prepended by a variable length int30 length and int30 StreamID and then the bytestream of data
 * The length value includes the length of the variable-length StreamID.
 * the int30 format is as follows
 *      if the highest value bit in the first byte is 0, the other 7 bits represent numbers 0-128
 *      if the highest value bit in the first byte is 1, and the highest value bit in the second byte is 0
 *            the first 7 bits represent the 0-127 remainder and the first 7 bits in the second byte represent
 *            the 0-128 significant 7 bit digit valued between 0 and 16256
 *      if the highest value bit in the first and second bytes are both 1
 *            the value between 0 and 16383 above is added to 16384*the third byte added to 16384*256*the fourth byte
 *
 * --Shutting down a Stream--
 * If either side decides to close a stream they must send a control packet (which is the implicit stream with
 * StreamID = default int30, which serializes to a single byte=0)
 * and then a control code which must be a byte equal to 1, and finally a variable length StreamID indicating which stream to close
 * This control packet must be broadcast on every related open TCP socket connection
 * This party may not reuse the streamID (given parity match) until it receives control packets with control code equal to 2 (close Ack) on all sockets.
 * The other side must keep the bargain and send the control packet with control code 2 on all sockets to allow ID reuse.
 *
 * If all streams are shut down, the sockets may be deactivated
 * If the socket disconnects due to error, then Disconnect callbacks must be called
