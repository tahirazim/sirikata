This is a simple chat application built on Sirikata and the Emerson
scripting plugin.  To run, run a space server

 > ../../build/cmake/space_d

and run the object host using the supplied configuration, which will
connect to localhost and provide you an avatar scripted for chat

 > ../../build/cmake/cppoh_d --cfg=chat.cfg


To run the "rest" of the world, i.e. the static part, run an object
host with the chat-static config and scene.  This only needs to be run
by the owner of the space to provide a barebones environment.  This
part does not start an avatar (and therefore doesn't start the
graphical display).

 > ../../build/cmake/cppoh_d --cfg=chat-static.cfg
