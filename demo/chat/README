This is a simple chat application built on Sirikata and the Emerson
scripting plugin.  To run, run a space server

 > ../../build/cmake/space_d [--servermap-options=--port=1234]

and run the object host using the supplied configuration, which will
connect to localhost and provide you an avatar scripted for chat

 > ../../build/cmake/cppoh_d --cfg=chat.cfg ["--servermap-options=[--host=example.com] [--port=1234]"]


To run the "rest" of the world, i.e. the static part, run an object
host with the chat-static config and scene.  This only needs to be run
by the owner of the space to provide a barebones environment.  This
part does not start an avatar (and therefore doesn't start the
graphical display).

 > ../../build/cmake/cppoh_d --cfg=chat-static.cfg ["--servermap-options=[--host=example.com] [--port=1234]"]


These are wrapped in some simple helper scripts for the server and client.
The server script wraps the space server and static content:

 > ./server.py [--host=example.com] [--port=1234]

And the client just runs the avatar object host:

 > ./client.py [--debug] [--host=example.com] [--port=1234]
