libtwitter
----------

This is a library supporting Twitter data in Sirikata. It isn't really
in any way directly related to Twitter, and it doesn't interact with
the Twitter service. Rather, it's just a set of support utilities
shared between multiple plugin (across the space and object host)
which are used when working with Twitter (textual) data.
