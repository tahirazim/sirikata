crashcollector
--------------

The crashcollector is a simple web service that shows how to collect
crash reports generated by breakpad, allow the user to add
information, and generate stack traces.

The server is a simple wsgi application. For this configuration, you
need:

* Apache - serves the pages by invoking crashcollector.py
* mod_wsgi - connects apache to crashcollector.py
* mod_rewrite - redirects pages to the correct script

Setup
-----

1. Move crashcollector.py and .htaccess into a safe location for
   hosting under apache. This might be under /var/www for example, or
   some other isolated user account.

2. Copy apache.cfg into your apache2/sites-available. Edit as
   appropriate, e.g. changing your host, setting up the directory for
   the server.

3. Copy the minidump_walkstack for your platform into the same
   directory as crashcollector.py.

4. Copy symbols/ directories into the same directory as the
   crashcollector.py.  See
   http://code.google.com/p/google-breakpad/wiki/LinuxStarterGuide
   for details on how that directory should be generated from binaries
   and what structure it should have.  Alternatively, use
   symbolstore.py, which is provided with this code.

5. Create a data/ directory in the same directory as
   crashcollector.py. This is where user uploaded data will be stored.

6. Run apache and start crashing!


Symbols
-------
The symbolstore.py script helps you generate collections of symbols.
Run it from within your build directory and it will generate the files
in the expected directory layout.
