/** Represents a backing store for persistent object storage. Each
 *  object is assigned an identifier which maps to a 'bucket' of
 *  values in the backing store, keeping each object isolated. Within
 *  that bucket, objects can write to keys, specified as strings.
 *
 *  Storage implementations *must* support transactions for atomic
 *  commits to multiple keys. There are two modes - transactions and
 *  single-key operations. In transactional mode, you call
 *  beginTransaction(), call other methods to add operations to the
 *  transaction, and finally call commit() to run the
 *  transaction. Single-key operations are called without any
 *  surrounding invokations of transaction methods. The implementation
 *  can send them to be performed immediately.  Single-key operations
 *  are really transactions, but elide the beginTransaction() and
 *  commit() calls.
 *
 *  Ordering of transactions (and single-key transactions) are not
 *  guaranteed: if you need to ensure operations happen in order you
 *  should either batch them in a transaction or wait for the callback
 *  for each one before processing the next.
